# Automatic_Image_Caption_For_Visually_Impaired_Individuals
In this Digital era ðŸš€, Visually impaired peoples are struggling to understand their surroundings without any external assistant. Even though existing systems like SeeingAI or Google Look out, they need Internet connection or Manual Navigation. So looking out this problem I developed a Raspberry-Pi based standalone system that captures the image using camera with a single button press then generate meaningful descriptions using CNN + LSTM. Then that descriptions will converted into an audio output. This Raspberry-Pi system Consist of a Camera, Speaker, Battery and a button. This proposed system requires no intenet connection, Easy to use because of the single button press.
